Hello, this is Kenneth. 

When running these series of scripts, make sure the following dependencies are installed:
python3
opencv v. 3.4.6.27
pip3

Please run "OpenCV_Run_Test.py" to verify that there are no dependency errors. 
If there are, please run "install.sh" (chmod 777 && ./install.sh) to install the necessary files. 

Also, it is worth noting that there may be additional pip packages you'll need to download. 

Good luck, and if something goes wrong, let me know!
