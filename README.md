# Hello there!
Welcome to Biola's Autonomous Electric Vehicle's GitHub Repo!

# Note to Devs
1. Prior to 'commiting' your program, please ensure that your program works. If your program requires additional attention, please document that on your commit. 
2. Please use the 'flag m' feature to document what you've changed. That way, other devs would know what happened!

# Hints!
If you're having problems comitting to GitHub via Mac, make sure you to run <code> xcode-select --install </code>. Xcode <em> may </em> break after an update.

If all fails, let Kenneth know about your issue!
